# Understanding Child Influencers within Social Network Communities: Evaluation Results

In this repository you can find the results that were collected during my bachelor thesis at the Chair of Information Systems of RWTH Aachen.

The results are split into 4 categories:

1. **collection**
    * Here, you can find statistics to countries, topics and subscriptions and views for the whole collected graph with 72577 youtube channels, as well as other atttributes. Furthermore, there are lists of English and German child influencers found under those channels
2. **centralities**
    * Here, you can find centralities run on the collected information. This includes Out-Degree, Closeness, (Neighbourhood) Coreness, Eccentricity and Eigenvector calculations and a combination of all previous ones by borda count. Lastly there are 4 Susceptible-Infected-Recovered results, also combined, for a smaller subgraph of all 347 child influencer nodes and 8045 randomly selected nodes with under 5000 subscribers.
3. **ocd**
    * Here, you can find communities generated by the SLPA, Clizz and LEMON algorithm for the small graph. The first two only include the inner connected component to account for easier viewing. Outside, there are only single nodes and connected components with under 5 nodes.
4. **user evaluation**
    * Here, you can find the results of the user evaluation of the graph visualization done during the thesis. The survey PDF is included as well
